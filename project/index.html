              <h2>Purpose</h2> 
              <p>I chose this subject because Prisma Idiomas is the institute where I work, and I believe having a professional online presence would help it grow and reach more potential students. A website will provide an easy and accessible way for people to learn about the courses we offer, contact us, and even begin the enrollment process online. It’s a meaningful project because it connects directly to my professional environment and can have a real-world impact.I chose this subject because Prisma Idiomas is the institute where I work, and I believe having a professional online presence would help it grow and reach more potential students.
